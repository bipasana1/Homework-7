2. What are some examples of how PHP and JavaScript are alike and how they differ?
Both PHP and JavaScript are interpreted scripting languages, meaning they are executed line-by-line by an interpreter rather than being compiled into machine code.
One of the primary differences between PHP and JavaScript is their typical usage context. PHP is primarily used for server-side scripting, meaning it executes on the server to generate dynamic web pages before being sent to the client's browser. On the other hand, JavaScript is primarily used for client-side scripting, meaning it executes in the client's browser after the web page has been delivered.

3. Define MVC, what are the responsibilities of each piece?
MVC (Model-View-Controller) divides an application into three components: the Model (manages data and logic), the View (displays the user interface), and the Controller (handles user input and updates Model or View). 
This separation helps organize code and improve maintainability in software development.
